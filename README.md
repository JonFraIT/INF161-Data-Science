# INF161-Data-Science
My project for the data science course at UiB Autumn 2022.

There is one file missing that I couldn't upload because of file size. Its similar to what you see in predictions.csv but with unfiltered messy data from many years.

I got 91/100 on this project. What I lost points from was that the exploratory data analysis was not done on training data only and the imputation strategy was missing.
